        "### **1. What is Differential Privacy (DP)? Why is it important in machine learning?**  \n",
        "DP is a mathematical framework that ensures an algorithm’s output remains nearly unchanged when any single data point in the dataset is modified, thereby preventing individual data exposure. In machine learning, DP is crucial because models trained on sensitive data (like medical or financial records) should not inadvertently reveal private information. By incorporating DP techniques, models can learn meaningful patterns while maintaining strong privacy guarantees, reducing the risk of privacy breaches.\n",

        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### **2. How does DP-SGD (Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent) modify standard SGD?**  \n",
        "DP-SGD modifies standard Stochastic SGD by introducing two key mechanisms: **gradient clipping** and **noise addition**. First, the gradients of each training sample are clipped to a predefined norm to limit the influence of any single data point. Then, random noise (like typically Gaussian) is added to the aggregated gradients before updating the model parameters. This ensures that individual contributions are obscured, providing privacy guarantees while still enabling model learning.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### **3. How is the privacy budget (ε) computed? What does a smaller ε imply?**  \n",
        "The privacy budget quantifies the level of privacy protection in a differentially private algorithm. It is computed using techniques such as RDP accounting, which tracks how much information about individual data points leaks throughout multiple training iterations. A smaller one implies stronger privacy guarantees because it means that the presence or absence of a single data point has less influence on the model’s output. However, stronger privacy often comes at the cost of reduced model utility, requiring a balance between privacy and model performance."

        "[Differential privacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_privacy) (DP) is a framework for measuring the privacy guarantees provided by an algorithm. Through the lens of differential privacy, you can design machine learning algorithms that responsibly train models on private data. Learning with differential privacy provides measurable guarantees of privacy, helping to mitigate the risk of exposing sensitive training data in machine learning. Intuitively, a model trained with differential privacy should not be affected by any single training example, or small set of training examples, in its data set. This helps mitigate the risk of exposing sensitive training data in ML."

This in turn decreases the (negative) effect of clipping on signal found in the gradient and typically maximizes utility. However, computational overhead can be reduced by increasing the size of microbatches to include more than one training examples. The average gradient across these multiple training examples is then clipped. The total number of examples consumed in a batch, i.e., one step of gradient descent, remains the same. The number of microbatches should evenly divide the batch size.\n",
